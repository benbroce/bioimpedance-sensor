"""

1. Read several short samples from ADC (several wave periods each)

2. Bandpass filter the sample using an IIR filter

3. Find the maximum and minimum values in each sample

4. Average all the maximum values and all the minimum values from all the samples

5. Calculate the peak-to-peak voltage of the input at the excitation frequency

6. Use this peak-to-peak voltage to calculate impedance
